# Softi Depository

### This is the depository for the acquisition of Softi, code for the CEP by Tonina Starita in 1968, to smoothen a curve.

This repository was created with the support of the 
[Software Heritage Acquisition Process Pisa Enactor](https://github.com/Unipisa/SWHAPPE) and contains 
the [raw materials](./raw_materials) and the [browsable source](./browsable_source).

[Information on the acquisition process](https://github.com/Unipisa/Softi-Workbench/tree/master/metadata) can be found in the [Workbench](https://github.com/Unipisa/Softi-Workbench).

The resulting 
[development history](https://github.com/Unipisa/Softi/tree/SourceCode/)  can be found in the [Softi repository](https://github.com/Unipisa/Softi).
